# Case Study: Regression - Real State

## Scenario

You are working as an analyst for a real estate company. Your company wants to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.

## Objective

Your job is to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset. Senior management also wants to explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tools. One of those parameters includes understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above.

## Approach

In order to get an understanding of the dataset, I did a first exploration using MS Excel. After that, I analyzed the data using 3 different methods:
1. SQL: extract data and create views for management
2. Python: main purpose is to run statistical analysis on the dataset 
3. Tableau: main purpose is for data visualization

## The data

The dataset provided for this project consists of information on 22,000 properties. The dataset contains a sample of historic data of houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015.

## Method

### Data Cleaning (Python)

1. Remove duplicates
2. Drop columns
3. Convert variables to binary

### ML Models (outliers removed)

1. Linear Regression model - Positive outcome
2. Support Vector Regression model - Non-satisfactory results
3. Random Forest Regressor - Positive Outcome
